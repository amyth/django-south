This repo is a fork of [django-south](https://github.com/dmishe/django-south) and resolves the infamous `UNIQUE constraint` bug. You can read about the bug in details [here](http://south.aeracode.org/ticket/747).

####Installation
<br>
```
pip install git+https://github.com/amyth/django-south
```
<br>

This is South, a Django application to provide migrations in a sane way.

By sane, we mean that the status of every migration is tracked individually,
rather than just the number of the top migration reached; this means South
can detect when you have an unapplied migration that's sitting in the middle
of a whole load of applied ones, and will let you apply it straight off,
or let you roll back to it, and apply from there forward.

Documentation on South is currently available on our project site;
you can find it at http://south.aeracode.org/wiki/Documentation
